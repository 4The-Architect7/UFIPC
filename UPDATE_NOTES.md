### üéâ Major Release: GPT-5 & Advanced OpenAI Models

This release adds support for **13 new OpenAI models** including the revolutionary GPT-5 series released in August 2025.

---

## What's New

### ‚ú® New Models (13 Total)

#### GPT-5 Series (4 models)
- **GPT-5** - Flagship unified model with built-in reasoning
- **GPT-5 Pro** - Extended reasoning for expert-level responses
- **GPT-5 Mini** - Fast, efficient GPT-5 variant
- **GPT-5 Nano** - Lightweight GPT-5 for high-volume tasks

#### GPT-4.1 Series (3 models)
- **GPT-4.1** - Advanced model with 1M context window
- **GPT-4.1 Mini** - Balanced performance variant
- **GPT-4.1 Nano** - Lightweight variant

#### O-Series Reasoning Models (3 models)
- **o3** - Advanced reasoning model
- **o3-pro** - Premium reasoning with extended thinking
- **o4-mini** - Fast, efficient reasoning model

#### Additional
- **GPT-4.5** - Pro-tier model (launched with GPT-5)

### üöÄ New Features

#### Quick Test Scripts
- `test_gpt5.py` - Quickly benchmark all 4 GPT-5 models (~15-20 min)
- `test_flagship.py` - Compare GPT-5 vs O-series head-to-head (~25-30 min)

#### Updated Menu System
- Organized by model family (GPT-5, GPT-4.1, O-series, Legacy)
- New comparison sets:
  - Option 30: GPT-5 family (4 models)
  - Option 31: GPT-4.1 family (3 models)
  - Option 32: O-series reasoning (3 models)
  - Option 33: All NEW OpenAI models (9 models) ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
  - Option 34: Top-tier flagships (4 models)
  - Option 35: ALL MODELS (19 models)

#### Enhanced Documentation
- Updated README with model categories
- Comprehensive model comparison tables
- Quick start guide for new models

## Model Count Comparison

| Version | Total Models | OpenAI Models | New in Release |
|---------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| v1.0.0  | 10          | 3             | -              |
| v2.0.0  | 19          | 13            | **+9**         |

## Breaking Changes

**None!** All v1.0 functionality remains intact.

---

## Installation & Setup

### Update Your Installation

```bash
cd UFIPC
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Your OpenAI API Key

**Option 1: Environment File (.env)**
```bash
# Edit .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
```

**Option 2: Environment Variable**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-your-key-here"
```

---

## Quick Start

### Test GPT-5 Family (Recommended)
```bash
python test_gpt5.py
```

### Test All New OpenAI Models
```bash
python ufipc.py
# Choose option 33
```

### Test Flagship Models (GPT-5 vs O-series)
```bash
python test_flagship.py
```

---

## Performance Expectations

Based on preliminary testing with GPT-5:

### Expected IPC Scores (Estimated)
- **GPT-5 Pro**: 0.80-0.82 (highest expected)
- **GPT-5**: 0.78-0.80
- **o3-pro**: 0.76-0.78
- **o3**: 0.75-0.77
- **GPT-4.1**: 0.74-0.76
- **o4-mini**: 0.67-0.69

*Note: These are estimates. Run your own tests for actual results!*

### Key Research Questions

1. **Does GPT-5 improve meta-cognitive capability over GPT-4?**
   - Hypothesis: Yes, 8-12% improvement expected

2. **Do reasoning models score higher on complexity?**
   - Hypothesis: O-series shows 5-10% higher adversarial scores

3. **How does GPT-4 ‚Üí GPT-4.1 ‚Üí GPT-5 progression look?**
   - Hypothesis: Consistent upward trend across all parameters

## API Key Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Your API keys are now stored in the `.env` file (NOT in code)

‚úÖ **Secure**:
- `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- Keys never committed to git
- Keys loaded at runtime only

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Hardcode keys in Python files
- Commit `.env` to GitHub
- Share your `.env` file

---

## Known Issues

### Rate Limits
- GPT-5 Pro has lower RPM (5/min) due to extended reasoning
- o3-pro has similar rate limits (3/min)
- Plan for longer test times with premium models

### Model Availability
- GPT-5 Pro may require Pro subscription
- Some models may have regional restrictions
- Check OpenAI dashboard for account access
